# node-red-contrib-envisalink
[DSC alarm systems] integration with [Node-RED] using the [EnvisaLink] hardware.

This node allows you to listen to state changes in your DSC alarm as well as sending
commands such as arming and disarming of your alarm.

# Install

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install

    npm install node-red-contrib-envisalink

Run the following command for global install

    npm install -g node-red-contrib-envisalink

# How to use

The output node, with which you send commands, takes a raw TPI command as a string.
Please refer to the [TPI documentation] for a full list of commands.
For example, to arm partition `1` using the code `9999` you would use the command `033` and passing `1` as partition and your code.
The final string to pass in to the output node would be `03319999`.
